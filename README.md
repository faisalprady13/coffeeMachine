### Description

A single page web application build with React.js, & styled with Sass.

### Functionality

It has included 6 sections, as required: **Landing**, **Description**, **Top Features**, **Technical Details**, **What's Included** and **Buy Now**.

For a smooth user experience a **Tracking Navbar** was included which actively highlights the section a user is on at a certain moment.

For styling it was used **Sass** which keeps everything organised using CSS Variables & Includes. This way the Styling File Tree is exactly the same as the React-App one which makes everything easy-to-find.
This web app was build for any type of screen on any device (TV, Desktop, Tablet, Smartphone) using modern responsive techniques such as **Responsive Typography** or **Responsive Images**. All elements were included in a custom made **12-colum Grid System**.

The **Footer** includes a copyright module which has a date function. That date is generated using Javascript in real time. If the year changes, the date changes automatically.
